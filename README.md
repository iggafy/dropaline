## 🌿 What is Drop a Line?

In a world of infinite scrolling and digital noise, **Drop a Line** is built for the tactile pleasure of reading. It’s a publishing platform that doesn't just live on a screen—it lives on your desk, in your hands, and on your shelf. 

Whether it’s a morning poem, a weekly newsletter, or a shared thought, Drop a Line turns digital transmissions into physical keepsakes.

- **Write with Intention**: Choose from classic layouts designed to look beautiful on a printed page.
- **Physical Inboxes**: Your "Following" feed is connected to your printer. When someone you follow "drops a line," your printer wakes up and delivers their message directly to you.
- **For Ink & Paper Lovers**: Built for thermal printers, desktop inkjet, or simply saving as a PDF to print later.
- **Private Letters**: Send direct, encrypted letters to specific friends that print only on their device.

## ✨ Features for the Indie Writer

- **Beautiful Layouts**: Handcrafted styles (Classic, Zine, Minimal) optimized for the physical page.
- **Scheduled Delivery**: Set your machine to print "Daily" or "Weekly" batches, creating your own personal morning newspaper.
- **The Library**: Keep a digital archive of everything you’ve sent and received.
- **Simple & Quiet**: No ads, no tracking, and no algorithm. Just you, your writers, and the sound of a printer.
