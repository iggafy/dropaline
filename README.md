  **Drop a Line** is a transmission network designed to bring the soul back to digital writing. It turns your screen into a printing press and your printer into a global mailbox.

## 🎭 What is Drop a Line?

In an age of fleeting scrolls and disappearing stories, **Drop a Line** is built for permanence and presence. It is a social protocol where "Posts" are treated as "Transmissions"—meant to be received, read, and recorded.

- **The Inbox as a Gateway**: Your feed is not a curated loop; it's a series of incoming transmissions.
- **Physical Integration**: Connect your thermal or desktop printer. Every "Drop" you receive can be automatically printed, turning your desk into an official relay station.
- **The Trust Handshake**: A decentralized approach to security. We prioritize independence over corporate signatures, creating a direct "handshake" between creator and reader.
- **Private Lines**: Send encrypted, direct-to-print transmissions to trusted contacts.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Rich Text Transmissions**: A premium writing experience with multiple layouts (Classic, Zine, Minimal).
- **Auto-Print Engine**: Queue drops to print instantly or in scheduled batches (Daily/Weekly).
- **Network Relays**: Follow the official **Drop a Line Network** for system-wide updates and community spotlights.
- **Cross-Platform**: Native desktop experience for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Digital Archives**: Full support for "Save as PDF" for those without physical hardware.

## 📜 The Philosophy
We believe writing should have weight. We believe the internet should be physical. We believe in the power of the "Drop."
